# LiSSA Annotations

This directory contains various iterations of annotations in our process. This document attempts to describe each file.

## *INTENTS - provisional name*
This file was created to double check annotations of methods dealing with intents. It was noticed that some of our early annotations concerning IPC and intents were not consistent with our later annotations. This file was used to reconcile any discrepancies.
